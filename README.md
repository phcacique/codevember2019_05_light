## About this app
![preview image](/images/05_light.PNG)

This apps use my swift package of Conway's Game of Life to represent a particle system that has a limited space inside words. You can swipe left or right to see the word light in different languages and colors.

_This is an iOS app, made in Swift, on XCode and it is a free visual experiment._
